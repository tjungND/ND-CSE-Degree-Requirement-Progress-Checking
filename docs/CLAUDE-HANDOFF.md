# Handoff for future Claude Code sessions

You are working on a built, tested, deployed app — not a greenfield project. This file is the
context capsule from the session that built it (Aug 2026, with DGS Taeho Jung answering the
policy questions). Read `CLAUDE.md` first (constraints), then this, before changing rule logic.
The git log is narrative — commit messages explain each step's reasoning.

## State of the world (as of 2026-09-01)

Complete and verified: engine (§2/§3/§4 requirements, 31 requirement rows), sheet loader with
plain-English diagnostics + snapshot fallback, UI (form, course table, transcript upload,
report), 60+ tests, GitHub workflows (test/deploy/sync-sheet), docs (README, MAINTENANCE,
data/README, DECISIONS, LICENSE). An adversarial multi-agent review confirmed 25 defects; all
fixed with regression tests.

Repo is pushed and public: https://github.com/tjungND/ND-CSE-Degree-Requirement-Progress-Checking.
CI note: the first two pushes (2026-08-31, 2026-09-01) FAILED in the `build` job because the test
script was `node --test tests/` — Node 24's runner does not accept a directory ("Cannot find
module …/tests"). Fixed 2026-09-01 to `node --test "tests/**/*.test.ts"` (60/60 pass on Node 24
and 22). Nothing was deployed to Pages until that fix landed.

2026-09-01 doc changes (no code): `DGS-READ-THIS.md` was replaced by a root `README.md` written
for two kinds of DGS — Track A (sheet edits, no code) and Track B (changing the app with Claude
Code or Codex, step by step); `LICENSE.md` added (University of Notre Dame dual license: free
non-commercial, paid commercial via the IDEA Center — leave it alone unless the DGS asks);
`AGENTS.md` added so Codex reads the same rules as `CLAUDE.md`. Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
consistent when either changes.

Known-pending (the app's diagnostics panel is the live truth):
- 7 Parameters rows for the DGS to paste into the sheet (`MAINTENANCE.md` § one-time setup) —
  still absent from the live sheet as of 2026-09-01.
- 3 mistyped Courses rows (`CSE 98900`, `CSE 68900`, `CSE 87701`: `regular`+`yes` but research/thesis).
- GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Source is set to GitHub Actions (2026-09-01). The URL
  (https://tjungnd.github.io/ND-CSE-Degree-Requirement-Progress-Checking/) goes live with the
  first green `deploy` run after the test-script fix above — confirm it, then link from cse.nd.edu.
- The sheet's own README tab still says the CSV links go in `src/data/sheet-urls.ts`; the real
  file is `data/sheet-urls.json` (sheet-side fix for the DGS).
- Snapshot commits made by the weekly `sync-sheet` Action use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which does not
  trigger other workflows, so the deployed fallback snapshot only refreshes on the next human push.
  Fix if wanted: add a `workflow_run` trigger on `sync-sheet` to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Non-obvious engineering decisions (and why — don't undo these casually)

- **Tests run on `node --test`, not vitest.** The repo once lived under a folder named
  `FY26-27 (DGS: Taeho Jung)`; the colon corrupted npm's PATH and broke vite-node's module
  URLs. The folder was renamed, but the dependency-free runner was kept. Node ≥ 24 runs the
  `.ts` files directly — hence the explicit `.ts` extensions on all relative imports
  (`allowImportingTsExtensions`). Vite still does dev/build.
- **`data/snapshot.json` stores raw CSV text**, not parsed JSON: one parse/validate path for
  live and fallback data, and the weekly sync commit diffs read as "what the DGS changed".
- **Status algebra** (`src/engine/status.ts`): every credit has a certainty tier —
  `definite` (passed + sheet says yes/attested) > `in_progress` (IP) > `provisional`
  (dgs_approval / unknown / non-CSE / transfer). A threshold row's status is the certainty of
  the worst credit actually needed; missing parameter ⇒ `cannot_evaluate` via typed accessors
  returning `undefined` (never a guessed default — a blank cell is NOT zero).
- **Cap allocator** (`src/engine/allocate.ts`) works at CREDIT granularity and is
  order-independent (the prototype's worst bug was entry-order-dependent verdicts — pinned by
  a permutation test). Greedy fill is provably optimal while every course touches ≤ 1 cap
  (true since the DGS ruled non-CSE 4xxxx counts nothing); a tiny exact search handles any
  future multi-cap case.
- **§4.4.2 distinct groups** use Kuhn's bipartite matching (`matching.ts`) so an `any`-group
  course (Research Methods) lands on the group the student is missing; a student's pinned
  choice is honored and a suggestion is emitted if suboptimal.
- **`effective_term` resolution**: newest Courses row not after the COURSE'S term; if every
  row is later (all 371 live rows say Fall 2026), the OLDEST row applies retroactively —
  without that fallback every pre-2026 course would resolve to nothing.
- **Reserved `category_group` codes**: `any` and `ineligible` (`RESERVED_GROUP_CODES` in
  `src/data/types.ts`) are valid on Courses rows but never matchable groups. The DGS marks all
  40000-level courses `ineligible`. If you see a sixth "group" appear in matching, this broke.
- **Retakes** (§4.4.2): only ND rows dedupe (foreign transfer ids can collide); the counted
  attempt is the last PASSING final, else a live IP retake, else the last failed one (which
  earns nothing — F/U earn zero credit by DGS decision).
- **Transcript upload** (`src/transcript/`): pdfjs-dist is the ONLY runtime dependency,
  lazy-loaded as its own chunk so the main bundle stays ~170KB. The parser handles Banner 8
  ("INSTITUTION CREDIT") and Banner 9 ("Institutional Credit") wording, ND's official-PDF
  layout (credits BEFORE grade: `BIOS 60574 Title 3.000 B+ 9.999`), Banner term codes
  (YYYY00=Summer, YYYY10=Fall, YYYY20=Spring of YYYY+1), and ND markers that may exist only
  in the browser print footer (an nd.edu URL). Image-only screenshot PDFs (students are
  literally instructed to screenshot by some ND offices) get a "print to PDF instead"
  message, NOT the not-ND rejection. **Never built against a real ND transcript** — parsed
  courses always preview for student confirmation, so format drift degrades safely; with a
  real sample, tighten `parse.ts` + its tests.
- **UI safety**: all user text renders via `textContent` (the old prototype had an innerHTML
  XSS); imports are deep-validated and a failed render never persists (no localStorage brick);
  "today" is computed in LOCAL time (UTC audited evening users as tomorrow).
- **Attestations**: DGS-approval checkboxes upgrade matching courses' certainty tier;
  `advisorApprovedPlan` only feeds the advisory approvals row. A CSE non-4xxxx `dgs_approval`
  course has no clearing checkbox by design (stays provisional).

## Invariants — keep these true

1. `npm test` and `npm run build` green before anything merges; `npm run e2e` for UI changes.
2. No network calls at runtime except the sheet fetch. No analytics ever. Student data —
   including uploaded PDFs — never leaves the browser (the page PROMISES this for FERPA;
   see the footer and MAINTENANCE.md).
3. Engine purity: no DOM/fetch/`Date.now()` in `src/engine/` — "today" is an argument.
4. Never guess: unknown course / missing parameter / unapproved thing ⇒ needs-review or
   cannot-evaluate, with the sheet problem named in plain English.
5. Every requirement function keeps its handbook sentence quoted above it; the requirement-id
   registry and fixtures must stay in sync (a meta-test enforces both directions).
6. Sheet schema is a human contract: changes need DGS sign-off + `data/README.md` +
   `MAINTENANCE.md` + fixtures/samples updated together.
7. Handbook beats code; DGS decisions live in `docs/DECISIONS.md` — read before overruling,
   append when a new call is made (date, question, decision, who).

## How to verify like the original session did

- `npm test` — scenario fixtures in `tests/scenarios/*.json` (schema: student + pinned
  `today` + rules patch + expected status/detail substrings per requirement id). Add one per
  bug, forever.
- `npm run e2e` — real headless-Chrome pass (see `.claude/skills/run-app/SKILL.md`).
- `npm run sync-sheet` — fetches the live sheet, prints its diagnostics, rewrites the snapshot.
- Read screenshots you take. A wrong verdict is easier to spot in the rendered report than in
  JSON.

## Recipes for the asks you'll probably get

- **"New handbook year"**: new PDF in `docs/` (keep old), update `CLAUDE.md` filename, diff
  §3/§4 old-vs-new, route numbers→Parameters tab, course lists→Courses tab, structure→code
  (quote the new sentence), update year strings in the UI, log decisions.
- **"Course X should count for Y"**: that's a SHEET edit, not code. Say so.
- **"Add a checkable requirement"**: implement in `src/engine/requirements/{shared,mscse,phd}.ts`
  with the quoted sentence; register the id in `audit.ts` REQUIREMENT_IDS; add a scenario
  asserting it (the registry meta-test fails until you do); wire any new number through a
  Parameters key (add to `KNOWN_PARAMETER_KEYS`, `data/README.md`, samples, fixtures, and tell
  the DGS the row to paste).
- **"Transcript parsing broke"**: get one real PDF, run it through
  `pdfToLines` in a scratch script, adjust `src/transcript/parse.ts` patterns, extend
  `tests/transcript.test.ts` with the (anonymized) line shapes.
- **"Grandfather a parameter change"**: Parameters have no effective_term — that's a real code
  change (mirror the Courses-row versioning); warn the DGS it's nontrivial.
