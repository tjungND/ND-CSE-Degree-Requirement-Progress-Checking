// The review request's two lists split on what an ask IS, not on its wording
// (policy review round 3, P3-emails-2; DGS 2026-10-06: "apply the suggested
// handling"). List A, "enter or complete these in the course rules — no reply
// needed", holds the sheet's questions; list B, "decide these for me — a reply
// is needed", the rulings for this student — a readmission, a lapsed
// Incomplete, an S grade … — which no sheet cell can hold. They used to land
// in A as "complete the row", with B repeating the same courses with nothing
// after the dash.
