// Conditional satisfaction (interface review R2, 2026-09-18). Three things the
// report used to get wrong at once, on the same rows:
//
//   1. a row read "Met" while naming the courses still waiting for the approval
//      its own handbook quote requires;
//   2. the credits a cap DISCARDED were printed as ordinary body text under the
//      green pill, so a row that costs a student three credits looked like an
//      unqualified pass;
//   3. the dashboard had no count for "satisfied except for a signature" — it
//      was folded into "not yet" with a parenthetical.
