// Coursework counts toward "all requirements" within the time limit (policy
// review round 3, P3-cse-3-1; DGS 2026-10-06: "Apply the suggested handling
// P3-cse-3-1. Apply the same change on PhD for symmetry."). CSE §3.3:
// "Failure to complete all requirements for the M.S. degree within 5 years
// results in forfeiture of degree eligibility"; Academic Code §6.1.4: "All
// requirements for the master's degree must be completed within five years"

// read only the milestones, so a course finished after the limit read
