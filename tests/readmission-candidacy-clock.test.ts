// The candidacy deadline after a readmission (policy review round 3,
// P3-ac-6.2-app-1; DGS 2026-10-06: "The clock counts by calendar semesters
// regardless of the gap. However, exceptions can be approved by the graduate
// school when requested by the DGS."). The eighth semester for the Oral
// Candidacy Exam and admission to candidacy counts the fall and spring
// semesters a readmitted student was away — only an approved leave is skipped
// — and while either is still to come, the rows say so and the review request
// asks the DGS whether to request the Graduate School's exception.
