// Where no document states a transfer limit, the number is the page's
// working limit and says so (policy review round 3, P3-cse-5-6-1; DGS
// 2026-10-06: "apply the suggested handling"). CSE §5.2 and Academic Code
// §4.6 state a limit only after an unfinished master's (6) or a completed
// degree (9 / 24). The transfer row called the 6 "§5.2's allowance for a
// student with no prior graduate degree" and, in the same sentence, said no
// document states it; the 2026-10-03 fix had left the prefix. The wording now
// follows the courses held for having no earlier program, so a student who
// finished the Notre Dame MSCSE (priorMs 'none' too) is not told they have no
// earlier graduate program.
