// A graduate course from an earlier Notre Dame master's in another department
// (policy review round 3, P3-dh-10-2; DGS 2026-10-06: "Apply the suggested
// handling on P3-dh-10-2"). CSE §5.2: "5) the transfer is recommended by the
// DGS and approved by the Graduate School. These five requirements also apply
// to the transfer of credits earned in another program at Notre Dame." The
// review request asked the DGS for an emailed recommendation the page could
// not record: no tick on the course (the Courses tab, not the transfer
// verdict, decided whether one was offered), so the course stayed "Waiting
// for the DGS" with nothing transferred. Its transfer decision is now an
// ExternalCourses row under UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME (DECISIONS 2026-09-05),
// asked for as a paste-ready row.
