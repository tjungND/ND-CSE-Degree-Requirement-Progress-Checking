// Notre Dame coursework taken BEFORE the entry term (2026-09-05).
//
// A student's Notre Dame unofficial transcript can hold an earlier Notre Dame
// degree — eight undergraduate semesters, a prior M.S., a 4+1 — on the same
// pages as the current program. Those courses are not this program's
// coursework: they do not count toward residence (§4.3), credits (§4.2) or
// specialization (§4.4.2), and their credits, if graduate, are §5.2 transfers
// ("These five requirements also apply to the transfer of credits earned in
// another program at Notre Dame"). §4.4.1 core knowledge is the exception —
// a core course passed "either at Notre Dame or at their previous institution"
// counts, and for a Notre Dame course the Courses tab already says which area.
//
// So a Notre Dame course dated before the entry term is filed as PRIOR
// COURSEWORK — except a course of the EARLY-START summer just before a fall
// entry, which is this program's own (P3-chg-other-1, DGS 2026-10-05;
// engine/early-start.ts): origin 'transfer', institution "University of Notre Dame",
// degreeLevel from the level the student was registered at (the transcript's
// UG/GR column, kept as `registeredLevel`; else the bachelor's award term
// when known (2026-09-06); the course number as a last resort).
// The sort is redone whenever the entry term changes, so correcting the
// dropdown re-files the courses without a re-import. Pure functions — no DOM.
