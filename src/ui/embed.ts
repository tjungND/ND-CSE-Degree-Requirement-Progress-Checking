// Embed mode — the pages rendered to sit INSIDE someone else's page.
//
// Why it exists: the department's WordPress site (sites.nd.edu, ND Blogs) can
// only put this app on a page through an [iframe …] shortcode — a Custom HTML
// block is stripped, because WordPress multisite withholds `unfiltered_html`
// from site administrators and KSES removes <iframe>, <script> and <style>
// from post content (tested on the live site, 2026-09-16). So the host page
// already carries the ND header, the page title and the site's own chrome, and
// the framed page must not repeat them.
//
// Turned on by an explicit `?embed=1` (or `#embed`) — never by sniffing
// `window.self !== window.top`, so the mode can be opened, linked and tested
// directly in a browser with no frame around it at all.
//
// Two pages, two treatments, and the difference is deliberate:
//
//   courses.html — a DOCUMENT. It broadcasts its height to the parent
//     (startHeightBroadcast below) so the frame grows to fit and there is no
//     inner scrollbar and no trailing white space.
//
//   index.html — an APP. Since 2026-09-16 (DGS: "remove the scroll just like
//     in the course rule page embed") it broadcasts its height too. An
//     auto-sized frame is exactly as tall as its content, so `position: fixed`
//     resolves against a viewport the size of the whole document — which is
//     why, in embed mode, the three dialogs are placed at the top of the
//     document (the opening notice) or beside the control that opened them
//     (`placeInFrame`), the toasts appear next to the student's last
//     interaction (`lastInteractionTop`), and the sticky score bar is hidden.
