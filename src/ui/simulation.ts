// for planning purposes … change the 'current term' and add courses and other
// items to see how things will go in the future."
//
// The model (DECISIONS 2026-10-09): the REAL record stays under state.ts's
// LS_KEY, untouched. The simulation is a deep copy of it, stored under
// SIM_KEY as { term, student }, and app.ts swaps that copy into its one
// `student` variable so every control on the page works on the copy. One
// persist() gate in app.ts saves the simulation while the mode is on and the
// real record otherwise; NO path turns a plan into the real record. A reload
// reopens in the mode (the stored simulation is found first); Exit discards
// the copy and puts the real record back from memory.
//
// The engine stays pure: audit(student, rules, today) is called with the
// simulated "today" (simulationToday) — the first day of the chosen semester,
// or the real date when the chosen semester is the real current one.
//
// Everything in this file is DOM-free except the three localStorage calls
// (mirroring state.ts), so tests/simulation.test.ts can cover the rest.
