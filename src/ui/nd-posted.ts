// One course, one row, whichever transcript arrives first (policy review round
// 3, P3-import-1 (c) and its condition 2; DGS 2026-10-05).
//
// The Notre Dame transcript's "Transfer credit accepted" block and the other
// university's own transcript can both list a course. The row the student
// already has is kept, and the Notre Dame record's acceptance rides on it as
// `ndPosted` — so Option 1 counts the course once, and the approval is never
// lost to the duplicate check. Removing an import takes back exactly what it
// brought: the Notre Dame import's marks, or the other transcript's rows (a
// row carrying a mark turns back into the Notre Dame record's block row).
// Pure functions over the record, so the rules have tests of their own.
