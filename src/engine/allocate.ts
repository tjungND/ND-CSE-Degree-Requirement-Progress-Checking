/** The processing order for the multi-cap courses that counts the most credits.
 *
 * Every order is still considered and the FIRST best one still wins, so the
 * answer is exactly what enumerating the permutations gave — but the search is
 * a depth-first walk with memoing and a bound instead of a materialised list of
 * n! orders. The old version built every permutation up front: 10 courses is
 * 3.6 million arrays, 11 is 40 million, and a student with eleven unreviewed
 * prior-program courses (a transfer candidate that is also non-CSE draws on two
 * caps, so it lands here) froze the page at load for minutes on end while the
 * browser allocated them — a renderer pinned at ~200% CPU and Chrome's "Page
 * Unresponsive" (DGS report 2026-09-16). The walk below visits each remaining
 * set × cap-room state once.
 *
 * Why the result is unchanged: the credits a course takes depend only on the
 * room left when its turn comes, so what an order is worth from here on depends
 * only on (which courses are left, how much room each cap has) — never on how
 * the prefix got there. Children are visited in array order, which is
 * lexicographic permutation order, and a candidate replaces the best only when
 * it counts STRICTLY more, so the first best order is the one that survives —
 * and a branch whose optimistic bound cannot beat the best is skipped, which
 * can never discard a strictly better order. */
