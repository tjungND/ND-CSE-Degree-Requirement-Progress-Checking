// Which courses still need a DGS decision — and why. Moved out of the "Ask
// the DGS to review" card (2026-09-06 evening) so the rule is one pure
// function with a test matrix (tests/review-pending.test.ts).
//
// The DGS's rulings for courses from other universities live in the
// ExternalCourses tab. A row there is a DECISION only where its cells say
// something: `transferable` (yes / no) decides the §5.2 part, and
// `satisfies_core_area` (a core area, or `none`) decides the §4.4.1 part.
// `transferable = dgs_approval` (DGS 2026-09-08) is a decision about the
// COURSE — outside the usual CSE ground, transferable when it serves the
// dissertation — but not about this student, so such a course stays in the
// request until the DGS has ruled on their case. A
// row pasted straight from the review request — both cells still blank — is
// not a decision yet, and the course stays in the request. (The card used to
// treat any row as "ruled" and dropped such courses for good — the DGS's
// "the card disappears and never reappears until the courses are re-added".)
//
// §4.4.1: the core-knowledge courses may have been passed "either at Notre
// Dame or at their previous institution" — undergraduate or graduate — once
// the DGS confirms the course. §5.2 criterion 5: "the transfer is recommended
// by the DGS and approved by the Graduate School."
