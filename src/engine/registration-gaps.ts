 * after the last one up to the current semester, the range the full-time list
 * already uses: a student on leave this semester has no later registration to
 * frame the gap. Undefined when no Notre Dame transcript was imported — a
 * hand-entered record may leave a research-only semester empty, so nothing is
 * read into an empty semester there (2026-10-04). A transcript imported
 * before this semester's registration posts names the current semester too;
 * the student leaves the leave count at 0. */

/** The transcript's unregistered semesters when the student's answer does not

 * for both parts): a leave count is entered, no readmission term is, and the
 * transcript shows more falls and springs without registration than the leave
 * count. Academic Code §5.1: "If the student does not return at the end of the
 * leave of absence period, he or she is no longer considered a student at
 * Notre Dame" — so a semester the leave does not cover means a readmission
 * (DGS Handbook §3.1, §3.3). A leave lasts at most two consecutive semesters
 * (CSE §5.7, for everyone — 2026-10-07, P3-ac-5a-4 (a)), so a run of three is
 * more than a count of two covers. The current semester is left out: its
 * registration may not have posted when the transcript was printed. With no
 * leave count the selector already asks (2026-10-04). Undefined when there is
 * nothing to say. */
