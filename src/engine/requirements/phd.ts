 *
 * Academic Code §6.2.9: "To qualify for admission to doctoral candidacy, a

 * all training modules for the Responsible Conduct of Research and Ethics
 * requirements", and: "Students must be admitted to degree candidacy by the

 * exams by the end of the ninth semester" and does not mention admission; the

 * also mention probation"), so their row counts the ninth semester and names
 * the probation too.
 *
 * CSE has no language requirement (§5.3), and its written candidacy exam IS

 * coursework is the OCE row's own measure — the regular-course credits
